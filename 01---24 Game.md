# 24 Game Solver  

## Description  
The **24 Game** tests a person's mental arithmetic. The goal is to arrange four given digits using arithmetic operations so that the result evaluates to **24**.  

## Problem Statement  
Implement a function that:  
- Takes a **string of four digits** as input, where each digit is from **1 to 9** (inclusive), and repetitions are allowed.  
- Returns an **arithmetic expression** that evaluates to **24**.  
- If no such solution exists, returns `"no solution exists"`.  

## Rules  
1. **Allowed Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
2. **Division Handling:** Should use **floating point or rational arithmetic** to preserve remainders.  
3. **Forming Multi-Digit Numbers:** **Not allowed** (e.g., `"12+12"` is invalid for input `"1221"`).  
4. **Digit Order:** The order of given digits **does not need to be preserved**.  

## Examples  

| Input  | Output |
|--------|----------------|
| `solve24("4878")` | `(7-8/8)*4` |
| `solve24("1234")` | `3*1*4*2` |
| `solve24("6789")` | `(6*8)/(9-7)` |
| `solve24("1127")` | `(1+7)*(2+1)` |

## Rough Thinking  

```plaintext
* Takes in a string of four digits.
* Each digit is from 1 to 9 (inclusive) with repetitions.
* Returns an arithmetic expression that evaluates to 24.
* OR returns "no solution exists".
* Operators allowed: *, /, +, -.

* Given four digits, obtain all four-slot permutations of the digits (no repetitions allowed).
  (e.g '4878' => 4887, 7884, 8487 e.t.c)
* Given four symbols, obtain all three-slot permutations of the symbols (with repetitions allowed).
  (e.g '*/+-' => **/, ///, */- e.t.c)

* Now, let's discuss bracket positioning:
    - It dictates THE ORDER OF OPERATIONAL EVALUATION.
    - Since we have 3 operators, operational evaluation happens in 3 steps.
    - The concept of BODMAS prevents excess brackets, e.g., (7-8/8)*4 and (7-(8/8))*4.
      In this example, the second bracket is useless because division already evaluates before subtraction as per BODMAS rule.
    - Hold on, what if there are a set number of ways to arrange the brackets?
      This means for each permutation, we simply go through each possible bracket arrangement.

* I think, I am taking it backwards
  let's take a digit permutation like 3142
  let's take a symbol permutation like */+
  that means we would have 3*1/4+2
  now we need to compute this in any order possible first
      to do that we know there are 6 ways of computing that 123, 132, 231, 213, 312, 321
      123 means compute the first symbol first, then the second symbol, then the third symbol
  we get the result of each order,
  we pick the order that has the right result
      and then we convert e.g 3142, */+, 231
      to a notation having brackets, i.e 3*((1/4)+2)
  normally in the notation, there should be 2 bracket pairs,
      But there are some cases where there would be one bracket pair
      e.g 3142, */+, 213 would be 3*(1/4)+2
      notice it is not (3*(1/4))+2
      there was no need to place the bracket because the evaluation process prioritizes * over +
      that means sometimes the first bracket may not be necessary
      No, I do not think the thinking should go that way
      because in this case 3142, -/+, 213 it should be (3-1/4)+2 and not (3-(1/4))+2
      because according to 213 the first operator is /
          and the second operator is -
          since the / has more priority than -, there is no need to use brackets to separate the evaluation
          since the third operator is +
          and _ and + have the same priority, there is a need to use brackets to separate the evaluation
          so we can conclude that
          the use of the first pair of brackets depends on whether
          The first operator had the same priority level as the second operator
          the use of the second pair of brackets depends on if
          The second operator has the same priority level as the first operator
          since we are only dealing with operators *, /, +, -
          the priority table would be
          + -> 1
          - -> 1
          * -> 2
          / -> 2
          let's look at an example 3142, ***, 231
                Should we place the first pair of brackets, YES or NO
                NO, because knowing that the first operator is *, and the second operator is *
                and they have the same priority level, which is 2
                Should we place the second pair of brackets, YES or NO
                NO, because knowing that the second operator is *, and the third operator is *
                and they have the same priority level, which is 2
          let's look at another example 6897, */-, 132
                Should we place the first pair of brackets, YES or NO
                YES, because knowing that the first operator is *, and the second operator is -
                and they have a different priority level
                Should we place the second pair of brackets, YES or NO
                YES, because knowing that the second operator is -, and the third operator is /
                and they have  a different priority level

* so with the current understanding, I think we have a plan
    1) get the four slots permutation of digits
    2) get the three-of-four slots permutation of symbols
    3) knowing we have 6 order permutations, pick a digit-permutation, pick a symbol-permutation, pick an order permutation, evaluate and check if the result is 24
    4) If the result is 24, then we have to return an expression with the right bracket notations. In the expression, we would sandwich the digits and the symbols starting with the digit, the order permutation chosen, let us whether or not to place the first pair of brackets and the second pair of brackets
